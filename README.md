League of Legends Color Changer- PC Version
Hi, this is Andrew Ou, also known as "ClawofBeta" or "Corn."

Execute the jar file to run this.

Does not currently work with patch 3.14

Ever want to change the HP bar color of just your champion so you can spot it more clearly? Or your enemies? 
Hate the blue of your mana bar? Well, I spent part of last week writing a program 
(...in Java. Shut up, I know I only know that or Python, and I didn't feel like writing it in Python X_X). 
Yeah, I know there are like one or two floating out there, but one has a lot of bugs and the other one, while neat, 
breaks every patch, and the owner apparently doesn't have the source code anymore. Mine also has the ability to 
change mana bar and energy bar colors and can restore to default, BUT keep in mind that affects Normal, Spectator, 
and Colorblind. This does not work with LoLReplay, and obviously affects only your computer. Yes, this is legal.
This is really my first programming project by myself, so yeah.

If you're a good boy and installed the League of Legends folder in the default location, you probably don't need 
to change the path. However, if you didn't, make sure you choose your Riot Games folder (the default is C:/Riot Games). 

Now, I want you guys to be able to break the program, or give me some critiques. I know the GUI is a bit messy, 
but well...it's Java swing, which is honestly a pain. The program also doesn't save your choices from the last time 
you opened the program (however, it does save the changes for the game...obviously).

Yes this is completely legal by Riot:

No this is not a virus:

If you want the Mac version, you're in the wrong place buddy. Look here:

If you have a Windows you should have no excuse as to where your Riot Games FOLDER is located.

This should not break on every patch, short of something disastrous such as the pineappleing ini file changing names like in the beginning of 3.8.

JAR FILE: Yes, you must have Java to use this.

What else should I include...oh yeah, I'm not affiliated with Riot Games. Yet =P.
